Having found an [awesome little wrapper][1] for [Snowball][2] (which allows 
for stemming of words, like "going" -> "go"), I decided that it was the perfect 
opportunity to try creating my very own "Clojar" and deploying it. It didn't 
take long to fork the repo, make an account on clojars.org, make some minimal 
changes, and deploy this library. The nice thing is that everyone now has an 
easy way to try this out. I'm honestly surprised it was this easy and quick 
to deploy the thing!

Check out my fork: ([https://github.com/gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)][3]

And the clojar itself is here: ([https://clojars.org/org.clojars.gnarmis/snowball-stemmer)][4] 

Cheers!
