Northwestern's [CATS][1] group is an amazing mix of technical and creative 
talent, and I recently had a great opportunity to help people interested in 
web development get their feet wet. I decided to choose Sinatra, which I'm 
actively using at my [work][2] and which allows a greatly simplified introduction 
to real web development.

Here's a link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=oDwZPXfCOYs 

Also, here's a link to the associated Github repo: https://github.com/gnarmis/meerkat 

Based on this experience, I'm hoping to teach a few more mini-courses in the 
coming quarters. Maybe RESTful services? Mobile dev? There's quite a few useful 
topics to choose from.
