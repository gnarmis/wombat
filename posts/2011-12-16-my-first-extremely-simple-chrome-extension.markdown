...and it was really quite simple to do! **Sherlock** is pretty stupid: all 
you can do is click on him to specifically google the current tab's website. 
So, if you find yourself adding "site:example.com" to your Google searches 
often, this should be a nice shortcut.

Here's the MIT-licensed code: [https://github.com/gnarmis/sherlock][1]. Download 
the install package [here][2];Â double-click to install. I've even put this 
puny release on the Chrome Web Store, but it's not showing up yet.

**EDIT: [this link][3] should work!**

I'd love some comments/feedback! I'd rather not spend my precious winter break 
on a doomed hobbyist project...
