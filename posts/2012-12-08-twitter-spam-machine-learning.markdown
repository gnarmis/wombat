Marcel Flores, Maciej Swiech and I have been working hard on our
machine learning project, in which we are asking whether we can detect
twitter spammer upon account creation, before they've made a single
spammy tweet. Our results have been promising and I'm posting here a
link to the project website: [Ready Spam Detection in Twitter][1].

At the above link you'll find our project details, approach, results,
analysis, and an accompanying extended abstract in ACM format.
