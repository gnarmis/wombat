Introducing Rocketship: a Rack based template that integrates multiple micro-frameworks. 

[**github.com/gnarmis/rocketship**][1]

 

I recently came across some useful Sinatra templates and ended up having to 
integrate several things together in a service I'm currently working on. So, 
I extracted the basic stuff out and it's turned out to be useful for spinning 
up a quick web service. Best thing is that it doesn't impose a strict structure 
and you can follow best-practices of your micro-framework of choice.

Currently, Rocketship integrates Grape and Sinatra, along with a bevy of testing 
facilities.

Comments/improvements welcome!
