[Noir][1] is an excellent, Sinatra-like framework in Clojure, and [Korma][2] 
is a great companion. But in a lot of database-backed services, you often need 
migrations to make sane changes to the database and have the abilitiy to roll 
back your various schema changes. Lobos is a little library (among a few) that 
tries to do this, but seeing only a few examples [here][3] and [there][4], 
I decided to make my own little template that explores this.

So, here's the repo:Â https://github.com/gnarmis/korma-lobos-tpl

I did run into an issue trying to find out how to do the classic "alter" SQL 
command to add a column using Lobos. Turns out, just try `(doc alter)` after 
first typing in that first long `(use ...)` command in the repo's readme. But 
I just documented the bug for now.

Also, there is a very simple entity definition to demonstrate Korma, and I've 
tested the setup and confirmed that the migration executed, and the entity 
got added.

I'll maybe explore Drift in the future, although there's already [this excellent 
template][5] I could build on.
