Me and Jon are finally at the stage where we can start showing off our
idea called SoundBoard, which was conceived and well received at a
hackathon last weekend. After talking about it with several great
people at TEDxUChicago, we feel the need to learn as much as possible
about how people use it. We have also put up a link on the site to
allow easy feedback, so be sure to check it out and tell us what you
think!
