#Thoughts About Strangeloop 2014

For those not yet familiar with the awesomeness of Strangeloop, it is a yearly
conference about “emerging languages, concurrent and distributed systems, new
database technologies, front-end web, and security." This year, Strangeloop was
at the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis, and I found it informative, inspiring,
and incredibly fun.

I decided to take some time and compress my experience into a reasonable blog
post, focusing on only the things that jumped out as interesting or worthy of
exploration.

I took notes about these talks (but went to many more):

**[The Mess We're In](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/the-mess-were-in)**

**[Deterministic Simulation Testing of Distributed Systems](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/testing-distributed-systems-w-deterministic-simulation)**

**[Consensus Without Consistency](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/consistency-without-consensus-in-production-systems)**

The most interesting topics I learned (grouped by talks I took notes about) were:

###The Mess We're In:

- It’s incredibly fun to think about the ultimate computer and what it could
  do. Imagine black holes as computers! And check this out: "Ultimate Physical
  Limits to Computation" —
  http://www.signallake.com/innovation/SLloyd021400.pdf

- URIs are leaky and broken; how about something like
  `hash://988881adc9fc3655077dc2d4d757d480b5ea0e11`? Instant verification of a
  piece of content? Noticing changes easily? How do you design a nice, general
  resource identifier with better guarantees than URIs? This allows us to refer
  to something without names or locations

- How about “least compression difference” as a metric to figure out file
  similarity? `A ~ B if size(compress(A)) ~ size(compress(concat(A,B))`. Joe
  calls this a good step in making a “Condenser” (a reducer of entropy; just
  merge all very similar files somehow, along with only having unique files)

- Joe compares the number of possible states of a computer program to the
  number of atoms in the universe. Shouldn’t the comparison instead be to the
  number of possible configurations of atoms in the universe? That’s a lot
  more, right? But programs definitely are complex beasts.

### Deterministic Simulation Testing of Distributed Systems

- Will recommends debugging the simulation of a distributed system instead. I
  think this ends up working as an approach because in the process of building
  this simulation, you nail down your assumptions as code and actually codify,
  somewhat, the possible lifetimes of your system. Instead of just coding up
  the system (while testing individual bits inside the system), now you’re
  doing that and also incorporating knowledge about possible run times.

- I really like Will’s point about trying to make your CPU’s more efficient
  than the real world. I mean, the universe is trying to find bugs in your
  distributed system (as people use it, bugs arise), and so is your
  deterministic simulation testing setup. Your job is to find those bugs faster
  than the universe finds them. I guess this is why they chose Flow and C++,
  for performance reasons. The more possible lifetimes you can simulate, the
  more bugs you can find before they actually appear.

- To explore: Hurst exponent, stable parisian distributions, Paxos and how the
  common approach might not correspond to real behavior of unreliable
  processors


### Consensus Without Consistency


- CAP theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance, pick two.

- Systems like Paxos, Raft, Zab, and Viewstamped Replication represent the
  solutions that prefer Consistency and Partition Tolerance

- Systems like Cassandra, Riak, Mongo, and Couch represent the solutions that
  prefer Availability and Partition Tolerance

- Things to explore: 
  - CALM principle (consistency as logical monotonicity)
  - ACID 2.0 (of course, it’s atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
  - CRDT (conflict free replicated data)
  - Fan out on write vs fan in on read
