Title: my hackathon experience last weekend

Me and Jonathan Chan (@jonishungry) had quite the adventure last
weekend. Managing a two hour El ride; being completely lost on the
UChicago campus; sleeping in a tiny student government office since
the venue wasn't 24/7 (graciously provided by @hackuc); discovering
that Fermi worked in Ryerson Hall (where we hacked), and that Carl
Sagan used to go to the observation tower there. Oh, and winning
second place (by 1 vote)!

The app we built was [SoundingBoard][1]: a crowd-driven music player.
Let's say you have a venue and you want to play some music while also
allowing people to suggest artists they love (with minimal effort on
your part). You sign in with an Rdio account, give us the place name
in a hashtag-friendly manner, give us the place's address, and we
setup a page for you that plays songs. Now, put this up on a screen
and people can tweet their favorite artists (with the appropriate
hashtag) in order to add them to the artist pool. The player then
randomly selects from the artist pool, which ranks artists based on
the number of mentions in tweets/retweets. Needless to say, it was an
API-wrangling bonanza, with lots of hard decisions about which
features we had to cut and which were absolutely essential to the
experience. It was also probably our most productive 30 hour sprint
ever.

We successfully demoed our app, adding tweets live which were parsed
for artist names, updating the pool and affecting the next song's
choice. And we almost won the whole thing! But it's ok; we still got
VIP tickets to TEDxUChicago, which promises to be amazing. Enova, the
company backing the hackathon, and the hack@uchicago team
(@hackuc) should be lauded for supporting such an amazing event.

We were definitely thrilled to see some validation of our idea and
want to explore it further. Any updates will be up on our launch-rock
page at [http://soundingboard.heroku.com][1], and emailed to everyone
who's signed up to our mailing list!
