# Wombat

Yet another static blog generator, in the spirit of Jekyll, Hakyll,
etc, with Markdown post creation,
[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)
powered HTML rendering, and
[garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)
powered styling.

## Goals

- A clean and text-focused design.
- As completely Clojure-ified as possible.
- Don't overengineer!
  
## Motivation

I'm tired of using Octopress, and I've been itching to make my own
static blog generator designed from the ground up to be used by me.

## Usage

FIXME
